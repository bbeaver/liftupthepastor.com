Being able to step away from the rigors of pastor ministry for three weeks was a great encouragement to me and my family. With his pastor&#8217;s heart, Dr. Standard stepped in and ministered to our church during the sabbatical with great love and care. I wholeheartedly recommend Lift Up The Pastor to any and every pastor.&#8221;    Dr. Brett Mask &#8211; Pastor at Salem Baptist Church<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;The opportunity for a four-week Sabbatical thru Lift Up the Pastor in 2022 was a blessing from God for my family. I am grateful that Bro. Rick followed the Lord\u2019s leadership in starting this ministry and that our church utilized it so I could take a break.  We worshiped alongside friends and family at other churches, enjoyed uninterrupted time together, and took a trip to the Ark Encounter. I would highly encourage any church to make use of this ministry to bless your pastor and his family.&#8221;   Jeff Wells &#8211; Pastor of Friendship Baptist Church Danielsville, GA<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Having had COVID in December 2021, I was experiencing some long lasting effects into early 2022 which inhibited my ability to carry out the daily routine as a Pastor of a local church. I had already been experiencing some symptoms of burnout, and those were accelerated through being ill. Our Deacon Chair received a letter in February 2022 from our Associational Missionary Strategist, Dr. Lex Bowen. In the letter he described a new ministry opportunity being offered by Dr. Rick Standard to provide a sabbatical for pastors.  Our Deacon Chair approached me about the opportunity in March, and I was floored at the opportunity, and at their enthusiasm to do so. Our Deacons endorsed the ministry of Dr. Standard to our church family, and it was affirmed unanimously by our Leadership and congregation.  From May 30 to June 18, 2022, I had time to rest and recover from the events of the previous months, and there are no words to describe the blessing of this time! Rick filled our pulpit at no cost to our church family, which is part of his ministry to the local churches that receive his offer. Our church family was encouraged by his messages over those two Sundays. As I stepped back into the pulpit on Father\u2019s Day I was refreshed and ready to step into whatever the Lord had for us.  I heartily recommend Dr. Standard\u2019s ministry to each pastor and congregation as it serves as a benefit to both parties. Our congregation is looking to see when they can schedule another sabbatical period in the near future. Special thanks to Dr. Bowen, and to Dr. Standard for their care and concern for pastors and the local church of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Blessings!&#8221;  Mike Sarna &#8211; Pastor  Meadow Baptist Church 6158 Highway 191 Comer GA 30629<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Related Links<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.restorativefaith.org\/post\/departure-why-i-left-the-church\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.restorativefaith.org\/post\/departure-why-i-left-the-church<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Testimonials Related Links<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"templates\/full-width-page.php","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-22","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/22","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=22"}],"version-history":[{"count":14,"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/22\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":222,"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/22\/revisions\/222"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/liftupthepastor.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=22"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
